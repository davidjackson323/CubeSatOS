# CubeSatOS
CubeSatOS is an operating system for cubesatellites based upon Python and the Raspberry Pi.

I will place all my relevant code here that I develop for satellite systems.

The goal is to develop a collection of python scripts onto the raspbian OS that will allow 
researchers to better focus on the development of the payload.

The OS will be able to handle power, attitude control, motor control, communications and 
data logging from custom sensors through the GPIO pins available.
